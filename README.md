# Stacked ensemble regression python module. 

This repository contains the python source code of stacked ensemble model for regressional analysis, namely **stacked_ensemble.py**.
Motivated by the blog article of [Why do stacked ensemble models win data science competitions?](https://blogs.sas.com/content/subconsciousmusings/2017/05/18/stacked-ensemble-models-win-data-science-competitions/), I created this ensemble model to boost the predictive performance of conventional machine learning models. The methodology of the stacked ensemble model is very similar to perceptron algorithm. During the training process, the all the submodels randomly select a subset of features and samples to optimize the parameters and the output results of the previous layer become the input for training the submodels at the next layer. The schematic belows shows the architecture of the stacked ensemble model. The training performance is surprising well for the small test errors. However this model has clear Pros and Cons as shown in the following:

Pros:
---
1. asdfsf
2. sdfds
3. fdsfsd

Cons:
---
1.dsfdsf
2.dfsfds
